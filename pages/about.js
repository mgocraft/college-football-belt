        <p style={{ marginBottom: '1rem' }}>
          This site tracks the College Football Belt â€” an unofficial title passed from team to team whenever the current holder loses. Inspired by the original website and the passionate fans who kept it alive on Reddit and Twitter, I wanted to bring back a fully featured, modern version.
        </p>

        <p style={{ marginBottom: '1rem' }}>
          Iâ€™ve built this site on nights and weekends, combining my love for college football with my background in data and web development. The goal is to make the Belt more accessible and engaging â€” with stats, history, and predictive features all in one place.
        </p>
        <p style={{ marginBottom: '1rem' }}>

        <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.5rem', marginTop: '2rem', marginBottom: '1rem', color: '#001f3f' }}>Support the Site</h2>

        <p style={{ marginBottom: '1rem' }}>
          If you enjoy the site and want to help with hosting and development costs â€” or just buy me a coffee â€” Iâ€™d really appreciate it.
        </p>

        <p style={{ marginTop: '2rem', fontSize: '0.9rem', color: '#666' }}>
          Thanks for visiting â€” and long live the Belt.
